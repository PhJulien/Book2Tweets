Four flowers on this plant, legitimately fertilised with pollen from a short-styled cowslip, yielded capsules with an average of 30.2 seeds.	DifferentFromsofFlowers	The Different Forms of Flowers on Plants of the Same Species	1877
In the latter case all the flowers produced capsules, whilst only 67 out of 100 of those fertilised with their own pollen produced capsules.	DifferentFromsofFlowers	The Different Forms of Flowers on Plants of the Same Species	1877
They were dwarfed in stature, and one lot of grandchildren had so poor a constitution that four out of six plants perished before flowering.	DifferentFromsofFlowers	The Different Forms of Flowers on Plants of the Same Species	1877
Accordingly, in 1861, several plants were similarly covered just before they expanded their flowers; these turned out as follows:- TABLE 1.5	DifferentFromsofFlowers	The Different Forms of Flowers on Plants of the Same Species	1877
Eighteen short-styled flowers legitimately fertilised yielded, as may be seen in Table 3.20, 15 fruits, each having on an average 2.6 seeds.	DifferentFromsofFlowers	The Different Forms of Flowers on Plants of the Same Species	1877
Long-styled oxlip, by pollen of short-styled primrose: 5 flowers fertilised, produced five capsules, containing 26, 32, 23, 28, and 34 seeds	DifferentFromsofFlowers	The Different Forms of Flowers on Plants of the Same Species	1877
It is absolutely necessary as we know, that insects should carry pollen from the flowers of the one form reciprocally to those of the other.	DifferentFromsofFlowers	The Different Forms of Flowers on Plants of the Same Species	1877
As the production of pollen by one set of plants is thus rendered superfluous, their male organs have become more or less completely aborted	DifferentFromsofFlowers	The Different Forms of Flowers on Plants of the Same Species	1877
The present species resembles to a certain extent in general appearance the common oxlip, which is a hybrid between the cowslip and primrose	DifferentFromsofFlowers	The Different Forms of Flowers on Plants of the Same Species	1877
Now a legitimate short-styled plant would have yielded, when legitimately fertilised, an average of 64 seeds, with a possible maximum of 74.	DifferentFromsofFlowers	The Different Forms of Flowers on Plants of the Same Species	1877

Nevertheless, after only 22 1/2 hrs. it was surprisingly softened, when compared with another bit of the same meat which had been kept damp.	InsectivorousPlants	Insectivorous Plants	1875
In the latter case the bits were dragged over the discs, so that they were well bedaubed with the secretion, and many glands thus irritated.	InsectivorousPlants	Insectivorous Plants	1875
Many experiments were made to ascertain whether the backs of the leaves could be irritated in any way, thirty-seven leaves being thus tried.	InsectivorousPlants	Insectivorous Plants	1875

The edge itself bears a row of conical, flattened, transparent points with broad bases, like the prickles on the stem of a bramble or Rubus.	InsectivorousPlants	Insectivorous Plants	1875
The tentacles are excited into movement by all the causes above specified; and aggregation ensues, with movement of the protoplasmic masses.	InsectivorousPlants	Insectivorous Plants	1875
The drops were replaced on the leaves, which re-expanded after 10 days; and now nothing was left except a very little transparent acid fluid	InsectivorousPlants	Insectivorous Plants	1875

It deserves particular attention that when the attached objects failed to act, there was no bending of any kind, excepting Sachs' curvature.	PowerMovemntPlants	The Power of Movement in Plants	1880
Thin slips of wood were cemented on more or less steeply inclined glass-plates, at right angles to the radicles which were gliding down them	PowerMovemntPlants	The Power of Movement in Plants	1880
We have met with only one exception, and that only a partial one, namely, with the petioles of the two first leaves of Acanthus candelabrum.	PowerMovemntPlants	The Power of Movement in Plants	1880
We thought, at first, that this difference in their positions was in some manner due to heliotropism, for the leaves are highly heliotropic.	PowerMovemntPlants	The Power of Movement in Plants	1880
In the first chapter of this volume, the remarkable oscillatory movements of the circumnutating hypocotyl of the cabbage have been described	PowerMovemntPlants	The Power of Movement in Plants	1880
Thus all four leaflets form together a single packet, with their edges directed to the zenith, and with their lower surfaces turned outwards	PowerMovemntPlants	The Power of Movement in Plants	1880
On the next day it circumnutated in a greater degree, describing four irregular ellipses, and by 3 P.M. had risen into a horizontal position	PowerMovemntPlants	The Power of Movement in Plants	1880
Besides this movement at the joint, there is another of a very different kind, for the sub-peduncle becomes upwardly bent in the middle part	PowerMovemntPlants	The Power of Movement in Plants	1880
In this species, whilst the leaflets are sinking, the petioles rise up, in two instances when the angles were measured to the extent of 23o.	PowerMovemntPlants	The Power of Movement in Plants	1880
At the base of the peduncle there is a mass of small cells, forming a well-developed pulvinus, which is exteriorly coloured purple and hairy	PowerMovemntPlants	The Power of Movement in Plants	1880
It appeared almost incredible that any plant, except a fleshy one, could have kept alive in soil so dry, which resembled the dust on a road.	PowerMovemntPlants	The Power of Movement in Plants	1880
Secondary roots sometimes spring from the lower surface of the peg, which thus seems in all respects to partake of the nature of the radicle	PowerMovemntPlants	The Power of Movement in Plants	1880
Nevertheless, any injury thus caused could be detected by removing the caps, and trying whether the cotyledons were then sensitive to light.	PowerMovemntPlants	The Power of Movement in Plants	1880
Thirdly and lastly, radicles when they first protrude from the seed are always geotropic, and plumules or shoots almost always apogeotropic.	PowerMovemntPlants	The Power of Movement in Plants	1880
The peculiar form of sensitiveness which we are here considering, is confined to the tip of the radicle for a length of from 1 mm. to 1.5 mm	PowerMovemntPlants	The Power of Movement in Plants	1880
On June 7th only a few observations were made, and the tracing merely showed that the leaf had moved three times upwards and three downwards	PowerMovemntPlants	The Power of Movement in Plants	1880
It should be premised that the nyctitropic movements of leaves are easily affected by the conditions to which the plants have been subjected	PowerMovemntPlants	The Power of Movement in Plants	1880
This occurred chiefly when the first curvature was small, and when an object had been affixed more than once to the apex of the same radicle	PowerMovemntPlants	The Power of Movement in Plants	1880

It was not possible to decide whether the leaves with their upper or those with their lower surfaces turned to the zenith had suffered most.	PowerMovemntPlants	The Power of Movement in Plants	1880
But this is not the case, for they were quite absent on some young seedlings, and did not appear until from 10 to 20 leaves had been formed.	PowerMovemntPlants	The Power of Movement in Plants	1880
During the next 11 h. the hypocotyl circumnutated, describing irregular figures, each of which rose a little above the one previously formed	PowerMovemntPlants	The Power of Movement in Plants	1880
It was then placed in the dark, and it now moved backwards, so that after 1 h. 7 m. it stood close to where it had started from at 2.18 P.M.	PowerMovemntPlants	The Power of Movement in Plants	1880
Those of Trichosanthes anguina are somewhat thick and fleshy, and did not rise at night; and they could perhaps hardly be expected to do so.	PowerMovemntPlants	The Power of Movement in Plants	1880
Of 24 control specimens, 23 were bent to the sieve, and on a second occasion 15 out of 16 were similarly curved in a greater or less degree.	PowerMovemntPlants	The Power of Movement in Plants	1880
It is probable that if the tips had been cauterised for the length of a whole millimeter, all signs of apheliotropism would have disappeared	PowerMovemntPlants	The Power of Movement in Plants	1880
During the second night it again fell, but only to a very short distance, and on the following morning re-ascended to a very short distance.	PowerMovemntPlants	The Power of Movement in Plants	1880
As far as we could judge, the advancing and retreating lines did not coincide, and if so, extremely minute ellipses were each time described	PowerMovemntPlants	The Power of Movement in Plants	1880
If this escape and flattening could have been prevented, the radicle would probably have exerted a greater strain than the 3 pounds 4 ounces	PowerMovemntPlants	The Power of Movement in Plants	1880
Unless this movement is admitted to be one of circumnutation, such leaves do not circumnutate at all, and this would be a monstrous anomaly.	PowerMovemntPlants	The Power of Movement in Plants	1880
